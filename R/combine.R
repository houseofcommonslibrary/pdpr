### Functions for combining related records in a dataframe

#' Combine consecutive records in a tibble of party memberships
#'
#' \code{combine_party_memberships} takes a tibble of party memberships and
#' combines historically consecutive memberships of the same party into a
#' single continuous memberships with the start date of thre first membership
#' and the end date of the last. Combining the memberships in this way means
#' that party membership ids from the data platform are not included in the
#' dataframe returned.
#'
#' @param collapse A tibble containing party memberships as returned by one of
#'   the fetch party membership functions.
#' @return A tibble of party memberships, with one row per party membership.
#' The memberships are processed and combined so that there is only one party
#' membership for a period of continuous membership within the same party.
#' @keywords internal
