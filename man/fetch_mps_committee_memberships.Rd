\usage{
fetch_mps_committee_memberships(from_date = NA, to_date = NA,
  on_date = NA, while_mp = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{from_date}{A string or Date representing a date. If a string is used
it should specify the date in ISO 8601 date format e.g. '2000-12-31'. The
default value is NA, which means no records are excluded on the basis of
the from_date.}

\item{to_date}{A string or Date representing a date. If a string is used
it should specify the date in ISO 8601 date format e.g. 2000-12-31'. The
default value is NA, which means no records are excluded on the basis
of the to_date.}

\item{on_date}{A string or Date representing a date. If a string is used
it should specify the date in ISO 8601 date format e.g. 2000-12-31'. The
default value is NA, which means no records are excluded on the basis
of the on_date.}

\item{while_mp}{A boolean indicating whether to filter the committee
memberships to include only those memberships that were held while each
individual was serving as an MP. The default value is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A tibble of committee memberships for each MP, with one row per
  membership.
}
\description{
\code{fetch_mps_committee_memberships} fetches data from the data platform
showing committee memberships for each MP.
}
\details{
The from_date and to_date arguments can be used to filter the memberships
returned. The on_date argument is a convenience that sets the from_date and
to_date to the same given date. The on_date has priority: if the on_date is
set, the from_date and to_date are ignored.

The while_mp argument can be used to filter the memberships to include only
those that occurred during the period when each individual was an MP.

The filtering is inclusive: a membership is returned if any part of it falls
within the period specified with the from and to dates.

Note that a membership with an NA end date is still open.
